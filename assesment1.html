	</ol>
	<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="space">Inline- by using the style attribute inside html document.</span></li>
		<li> <span class="space">Internal- by using a style elements in the head section.</span></li>
		<li><span class="space">External - by using a link element to link to an external css file.</span></li>
		<li><span class="space">The most comman way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However <span class="color">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>beacuse this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.</span></li>
	</ul>

	<p>When comparing css class vs ID,the diffrence is that css class applies a style to multiple elements,ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by javascript.<br><br>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.<br><br>There is a wide range of selectors availabe.Two of the most commanly used are class and ID.both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
